                From a troubled childhood in the American South to the
                battle-scarred fields of Ukraine,{" "}
                <strong>Tristan Seth Nettles</strong> has lived a life that
                almost defies belief. Born between wealth and poverty, armed
                with stubborn determination and a restless spirit, Tristan
                navigates a world that seems determined to break him to it&#39;s
                mold — and somehow survives, grows stronger, and fights back.
              </p>
              <p className="font font-serif">
                <em>False Positive</em> is the true story of a man who outruns
                his past but never forgets it. As a rambunctious youth, soldier,
                international dark web drug dealer, outlaw, lover, and
                mercenary, Tristan travels the world — from armed home invasions
                to mountain top temples, from Southeast Asian prisons to
                battlefields in Eastern Europe — chasing truth, redemption, and
                ultimately, justice. When the woman he loves, Ashley Oosthuizen,
                is wrongfully imprisoned and sentenced to death in Thailand,
                Tristans&#39; mission becomes clear. What began as a reckless
                search for freedom turns into an international fight for someone
                else&#39;s.
              </p>
              <p className="font font-serif">
                Told with dark humor, brutal honesty, and heart-stopping
                intensity, <strong>False Positive</strong> is a modern epic — a
                real-life odyssey in the spirit of <em>Forrest Gump</em> and{" "}
                <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>. It&#39;s a raw, unforgettable
                journey through love, loss, crime, war, and the deep, messy
                beauty of being human.
